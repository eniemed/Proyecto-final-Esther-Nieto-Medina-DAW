                <h2>How long does it take to receive my order?</h2>
                <p>The delivery time for your order can vary depending on your location, but generally, we strive to deliver all orders within 3-5 business days. Once your order is shipped, you will receive a tracking number via email so you can monitor the progress of your delivery. For domestic orders, the delivery time is usually on the shorter end of this range, whereas international orders may take slightly longer due to customs and local postal services. Rest assured, we partner with reliable shipping carriers to ensure that your order reaches you as quickly and safely as possible.</p>
